Achievements are mostly related to features offered by GitHub, so by unlocking achivements ranks you'll be mastering GitHub in no time!

A few achievements contains actual real ranking (based on [GitHub search](https://github.com/search) results)!

**About achievements ranks**

Moving forward between ranks is voluntarily difficult, making it almost impossible to reach the latest rank except by hard work.

With this design, when a user reach upper ranks you can be sure that they really deserve it!
It also lets you quickly see at a glance what this user primarly use GitHub for, just look for crimson and gold badges!
