### üèÜ Achievements

The *achievements* plugin displays several highlights about what you achieved on GitHub.

Achievements are mostly related to features offered by GitHub, so by unlocking achivements ranks you'll be mastering GitHub in no time!

Ranks **C** to **A+** are based on fixed thresholds while **S** ranks are dynamically computed to ensure you're at least in the top 10% of GitHub at any time (which also means that it is possible to lose them).
