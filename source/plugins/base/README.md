### üóÉÔ∏è Base content

The *base* content is all metrics enabled by default.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.classic.svg">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.organization.svg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It contains the following sections:
* `header`, which usually contains your username, your two-week commits calendars and a few additional data
* `activity`, which contains your recent activity (commits, pull requests, issues, etc.)
* `community`, which contains your community stats (following, sponsors, organizations, etc.)
* `repositories`, which contains your repositories stats (license, forks, stars, etc.)
* `metadata`, which contains informations about generated metrics

These are all enabled by default, but you can explicitely opt out from them.
